### 1. How profit and sales varied in 2018?

This is an interactive dashboard containing KPI’s, 2 line plots and a bar plot. By default, the KPI’s represent the performance of the company in the 4 years (2014-2018) but it can be filter (using the dropdown) to show them for a specific year (In this case 2018). The first bar plot displays the monthly variation of the profit. In December 2018, it was a substantial reduction in the monthly profit caused probably because the company had some additional costs in goods. In the second line plot it is evident that the sales over this year increased while the profit reduced steadily, supporting the idea that the costs increased during this year but kept the profit margin in 10%, which still looks financially positive. On the other hand, the sales were minimum during weekends in summer probably because the weather favors those consumers buy in physical stores rather making online orders. Then my recommendation to Unicorn is to apply some discounts and offers during these days.

### 2. Which were the most profitable state and city?

This dashboard contains 4 dropdowns, a map, a tooltip (this appears by hovering over the map) and a bar plot. The dropdowns above the map filter the data by year, by the number of top states and by profit or sales. By default, the map shows the top-10 states by profit and in turn this filter the bar plot to show just the cities included in these states. According to the map California and New York were the most profitable states but also the states with the most sales in 2018. The categories with the most profit in these states were office supplies in California and technology in New York.
Looking at the bar plot, New York City was the most profitable and the place where Unicorn get the maximum revenue so it if the company is interested in increasing sales and/or creating engagement with good customers, this city could be a pertinent place to start. Based on that, the next 2 dashboards I explored were the clients and products that render the highest sales and profit in New York City and which aspects could be improved for the next years.

### 3. Who bought the most during 2018 in New York city? 

This interactive dashboard contains a dot plot, a pie plot and a bar plot. In the dot plot are display the names of the top 10 clients organized by sales (Higher sales on the top). The total discounts and the number of orders are also included in this plot. Most of these “good clients” are in the consumer segment and, as well as the national tendency, these people bought less during the summer weekends. I recomend  that some good customers like Todd Sumrall, Steven Roelle and Justin Deggeller could receive better discounts, especially during summer weekends of the upcoming years, in order to made them more engaged with the company and consequently increase the revenue.

### 4. Which were the most profitable category and products in NYC during 2018?

Lastly, I decided to look at the products in terms of the profit they generated during 2018. The pie chart contains the three categories the company commercializes. Selecting one of the categories filters the products in the bar plot, which displays the top 5 and the bottom 5 products by profit. In the figure, the category furniture is selected in order to display its respective most and less profitable products. As this category was the less profitable during 2018, I recommend reduzing costs in some of the products that generated the most negative profits, such as the Riversade Palais Bookcase and the Balt Tables. On the other hand, some products rendered high profits, like the Canon ImageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier. In this case the company could focus its marketing strategies on these "successful" items for the upcoming years.
