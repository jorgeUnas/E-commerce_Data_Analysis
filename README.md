### 1. How profit and sales varied in 2018?

This is an interactive dashboard that contains KPIs, two line plots, and a bar plot. By default, the KPIs represent the company's performance over the four-year period (2014-2018), but they can be filtered (using the dropdown) to display data for a specific year (in this case, 2018). The first bar plot displays the monthly variation in profit. In December 2018, there was a substantial reduction in monthly profit, probably due to additional costs incurred by the company in goods. The second line plot clearly shows that sales increased throughout the year, while profit steadily declined. This supports the idea that costs increased during the year but still maintained a profit margin of 10%, which is financially positive. Additionally, sales were at a minimum during weekends in the summer, possibly because favorable weather conditions encouraged consumers to make purchases in physical stores rather than placing online orders. Therefore, my recommendation to Unicorn is to offer discounts and promotions during these days to attract more customers.

### 2. Which were the most profitable state and city?


This dashboard contains four dropdowns, a map, a tooltip (which appears by hovering over the map), and a bar plot. The dropdowns located above the map filter the data by year, the number of top states, and either profit or sales. By default, the map displays the top 10 states by profit, subsequently filtering the bar plot to show only the cities within those states. According to the map, California and New York were the most profitable states, also leading in terms of sales in 2018. The tooltip reveals that office supplies were the most profitable category in California, while technology dominated in New York.

Observing the bar plot, New York City emerged as the most profitable city, generating the highest revenue for Unicorn. Therefore, if the company aims to increase sales and engage with valuable customers, focusing on this city would be a relevant starting point. Based on this insight, I proceeded to explore the next two dashboards, which focused on identifying the clients and products that yielded the highest sales and profit in New York City. The objective was to assess areas that could be improved in the upcoming years.

### 3. Who bought the most during 2018 in New York city? 

This interactive dashboard contains a dot plot, a pie plot, and a bar plot. The dot plot displays the names of the top 10 clients organized by sales, with higher sales appearing at the top. Additionally, the plot includes information on total discounts and the number of orders. Most of these "good clients" are in the consumer segment and, consistent with the national trend, they made fewer purchases during summer weekends. I recommend that some good customers, such as Todd Sumrall, Steven Roelle, and Justin Deggeller, receive better discounts, especially during the upcoming summer weekends. This will help to further engage them with the company and, consequently, increase revenue.

### 4. Which were the most profitable category and products in NYC during 2018?

Lastly, I decided to examine the products based on the profit they generated in 2018. The pie chart represents the three categories that the company sells. By selecting one of the categories, the bar plot is filtered, displaying the top 5 and bottom 5 products in terms of profit. In the figure, the category of furniture is selected to showcase its most and least profitable products. Since this category had the lowest profitability in 2018, I recommend reducing costs for some of the products that resulted in the most negative profits, such as the Riversade Palais Bookcase and the Balt Tables. On the other hand, certain products yielded high profits, like the Canon ImageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier. In this case, the company could concentrate its marketing strategies on these successful items for the upcoming years.
